A simple, powerful and easy to use plugin that will help you to manage your contents in a multilingual multisite-installation.

== Description ==

A simple, powerful and easy to use plugin that will help you to manage the relations of posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies in your multilingual multisite-installation.

The plugin is using the flag-icons from [FamFamFam](http://famfamfam.com). Thanks to Mark James for his great work.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can [send me](mailto:re@lloc.de) your gettext PO and MO so that I can bundle it into the Multisite Language Switcher. You can download the latest POT file [from here](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/multisite-language-switcher/trunk/languages/default.pot).

== Installation ==

* download the plugin and uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme
* copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your wordpress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* activate the plugin in your plugin page
* set some configuration in Options -> Multisite Language Switcher

Now you can

* set the relations of your pages and posts in Posts -> Edit or Page -> Edit
* set the relations of your categories and tags in Posts -> Categories or Post -> Tags
* use a widget and/or a content_filter which displays a hint if a translation is available
* optionally you can use a line like `<?php if ( function_exists( 'the_msls' ) ) the_msls(); ?>` directly in your theme-files

Have a look at the [Multisite Language Switcher Wiki](https://github.com/lloc/Multisite-Language-Switcher/wiki) for more information.
